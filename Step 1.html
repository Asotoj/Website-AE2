				    <p>Social distancing, also called "physical distancing," is keeping a safe distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.
					To practice physical or social distancing, stay at least 6 feet (the approximate length of 2 outstretched arms) from other people who are not 
					members of your household, both indoors and outdoors.</p>

			</header>
			<content>
			<p>COVID-19 spreads primarily between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a long period of time. Spread occurs when an infected person
			coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are expelled into the air and end up in the mouth or nose of those close to them. 
			These droplets can also be inhaled and enter the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but have no symptoms likely also play 
			a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to keep a distance of at least
			6 feet from other people whenever possible, even if you or those people have no symptoms. Social distancing is especially important for people at higher 
			risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.</p>
