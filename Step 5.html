			</header>

				    <p>The first and most obvious way is recycling. However, you need to get the right containers for every type of waste that you will be recycling:
					plastic, paper, glass, metal, batteries and light bulbs, electronics, compost, etc. Around 75% of all the waste is recyclable, however, the uptake
					is very low. This is because people usually have no idea about which materials can be recycled and how to properly recycle those materials.</p>

				<h4 class="h6">Composting</h4>
			</header>
			<content>
			<p>Composting turns your food waste into fuel for your garden and it can suit gardens of any kind. Even if you are not good at gardening you should know that composting is always good for plants and gardens. And if you don’t have a garden or a plant somewhere nearby, you can donate that compost to a public garden. This will help the garden and limit your carbon footprint. Composting is not expensive. You would want to fill one small container with materials that are high in nitrogen and materials that are high in carbon. Green and soft are nitrogen-rich, and dry and brown are carbon-rich materials. Nitrogen-rich material usually comes from vegetables and carbon-rich from woody materials. You should keep the carbon-rich materials at the bottom so it could help aerate your compost. Keep adding those materials until you fill your container. It will heat up and you should give it a week or two to cool down. After that, you should mix it using a pitchfork and shred as much as you can. The smaller the pieces are, the smaller the scraps the shorter decomposition time you get.

				<h4 class="h6">Reusing
</h4>
			</header>
			<content>
			<p>You can save shopping for bags or buy one cloth bag and use it for life if you want. Similarly, you can reuse fizzy drink bottles for water on some hot days rather than throwing them away. You can do the same thing with wood, metal and glass.
